KEY TO SOLUTIONS TO PRACTICAL 2

SOLUTION TO PARTS 3.1-3.2:
data0.py = reads data from file and splits into training and test sets

SOLUTION TO PART 3.3:
data1.py = generates synthetic data for linear regression

SOLUTION TO PART 4.1, STEPS 1-5:
linreg0.py = basic linear regression method applied to an existing data set

SOLUTION TO PART 4.1, STEP 6:
linreg1.py = basic linear regression method applied to a synthetic data set

SOLUTION TO PART 4.2:
linreg2.py = scikit-learn linear regression method applied to a synthetic data set

SOLUTION TO PART 5, STEPS 1-2:
data2.py = generates synthetic data for linear classification (perceptron)

SOLUTION TO PART 5, STEPS 3-4:
per.py = scikit-learn perceptrion applied to synthetic data set
